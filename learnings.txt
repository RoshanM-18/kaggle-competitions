Improving the performance of machine learning models by understanding the seasonal component in time series

1. clearer signal -> identifying and removing the seasonal component cna improve the relationship between input and output variable
2. more information -> additional information about the seasonal component

removing seasonality
1. seasonal adjustment or deseasonalizing -> model of seasonality can be removed

a. seasonal stationary -> time series where seasonality have been removed
b. seasonal non stationary -> time series where seasonality have not been removed

Methods to remove seasonality
1. differencing
